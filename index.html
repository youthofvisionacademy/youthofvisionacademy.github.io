    <a href="https://yovainc.org/">Youth Of Vision Academy in Jamaica (YOVA)</a>
    for your child. We are former YOVA parents who have relevant and critical
    information for your research. Please drop us an email at

    If you are, as we were, frustrated with the failing US systems and desperate
    for where to send your child who is struggling to live in a home setting due
    to Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) or other severe mental illnesses, we
    truly understand and have been there. Perhaps you are looking outside of the
    United States due to costs or lack of options.
    YOVA is a "therapeutic boarding school" in Jamaica for troubled children
    and teens.
    They claim to be a RAD specific residential program,
    but not a treatment center (therefore, not a RTC or PRTF).
    YOVA is positioned as a low-cost boarding school and provider of an
    international Christian boarding school experience abroad. There is little
    available online, therefore we are providing our experience so you can
    make an informed decision as a parent.
